#+TITLE: My Janky Dotfiles

They're managed by a custom [[./bin/make_symlink][script]] that I wrote, which is
very much prone to breakages, so use it at your own risk.

This is an experimental branch where I'm testing nix-darwin.

* Installation
- Get the list of packages to replace using =brew leaves=.
- Install nix: =curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh=.
- Try running: =nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"=. What does this do?
  Builds a temporary environment where it installs =nix-info= package and runs
  =nix-info -m= in the temporary shell.
