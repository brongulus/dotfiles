# Renames subtitles files according to tv shows names found in a directory
# Acceped syntaxes for season/episode are: 304, s3e04, s03e04, 3x04 or 04 (case insensitive)
#
# Usage:
# Put this gist somewhere in your $PATH, like /usr/local/bin/subtitles-renamer
# Chmod +x it
# cd ~/YourHolidaysTvShowsWithSubtitles
# subtitles-renamer
#
# Note: zipfiles will be unzipped and .zip will be removed
#
# There are bashisms to work with regular expressions,
# so you really need bash or a shell compatible
