# Indivial exec command example:
# ln -sf ~/Dotfiles/.bashrc ~
# The find command lists all the files in Dotfiles dir 
# and performs the exec command (being ln -sf here) on
# all of them. We perform symlinks for individual files 
# since there might be directories inside the target 
# folder which we aren't tracking in Dots but still need
# for functioning so this doesn't overwrite them 
# -f is for force if existing

# FIXME: .git folder spits out errors, exclude it from find
